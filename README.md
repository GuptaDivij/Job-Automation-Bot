# NOTE : This is no longer functional due to auto detection of bots in Glassdoor. 
# Undetected-ChromeDriver can be used to avoid detection from websites like Glassdoor, which may otherwise block standard Selenium automation. However, this may be only used for educational purposes as it might lead to legal implications.
